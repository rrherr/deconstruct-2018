<p>Now that computers can defeat Go masters, and identify hotdogs, what's next? The holy grail: make music in the bluegrass banjo style of Earl Scruggs.</p>

<p>How does Earl "banjo-ify" a song?</p>

<p>This question led me on a journey, from my hometown of Normal, Illinois, to study with a banjo guru - in New Jersey, of course.</p>

<p>My guru said, start with a single note:</p>

<audio controls="controls"><source src="wavs/one_note_8.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>

<p>How can you hold long notes on instruments with no sustain?</p>

<p>Mandolin style is to just repeat it:</p>

<audio controls="controls"><source src="wavs/mandolin_8.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>

<p>But banjo style, you play syncopated, rolling patterns:</p>

<audio controls="controls"><source src="wavs/banjo.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>

<p>I internalized these patterns, I could do it - but, I didn't understand how. It's tacit knowledge.</p>

<p>But what if I tried to teach a computer? I'm programming a context-free banjo grammar, using Allison Parrish's Python port of Kate Compton's Tracery library.</p>

<p>I start with ABC notation, transform it to musical notation, and MIDI:</p>

<audio controls="controls"><source src="wavs/cripple_creek_1.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>

<p>Then I use replacement rules to "banjo-ify" it:</p>

<audio controls="controls"><source src="wavs/cripple_creek_3.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>

<p>Why? Because it's fun! It's absurd.</p>

<audio controls="controls"><source src="wavs/i_want_it_that_way_cropped.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>

<p>And the process of programming helps us understand things in new ways.</p>

<p>If you ever wanted to learn about grammars and the Chomsky hierarchy, well, here's a concrete, weird example.</p> 

<p>So join me this journey. Next stop, Seattle? Let's program a banjo grammar.</p>
