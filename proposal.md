Now that computers can defeat Go masters, and identify hotdogs, what's next? The holy grail: make music in the bluegrass banjo style of Earl Scruggs.

How does Earl "banjo-ify" a song?

This question led me on a journey, from my hometown of Normal, Illinois, to study with a banjo guru — in New Jersey, of course.

My guru said, start with a single note:

<audio></audio>

How can you hold long notes on instruments with no sustain?

Mandolin style is to just repeat it:

<audio></audio>

But banjo style, you play syncopated, rolling patterns:

<audio></audio>

I internalized these patterns, I could do it — but, I didn't understand how. It's tacit knowledge.

But what if I tried to teach a computer? I'm programming a context-free banjo grammar, using Allison Parrish's Python port of Kate Compton's Tracery library.

I start with ABC notation, transform it to musical notation, and MIDI:

<audio></audio>

Then I use replacement rules to "banjo-ify" it:

<audio></audio>

Why? Because it's fun! It's absurd.

<audio></audio>

And the process of programming helps us understand things in new ways.

If you ever wanted to learn about grammars and the Chomsky hierarchy, well, here's a concrete, weird example. 

So join me this journey. Next stop, Seattle? Let's program a banjo grammar.
